We simply propagate stochastic triples through the program via stochastic_triple, and then sum up the \"dual\" and \"triple\" components at the end via derivative_contribution. This process is packaged together in the function derivative_estimate. Let's try a crazier example, where we mix discrete and continuous randomness!","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"using StochasticAD, Distributions\nimport Random # hide\nRandom.seed!(1234) # hide\n\nfunction X(p)\n    a = p * (1 - p)\n    b = rand(Binomial(10, p))\n    c = 2 * b + 3 * rand(Bernoulli(p))\n    return a * c * rand(Normal(b, a))\nend\n\nst = @show stochastic_triple(X, 0.6) # sample a single stochastic triple at p = 0.6\n@show derivative_contribution(st) # which produces a single derivative estimate...\n\nsamples = [derivative_estimate(X, 0.6) for i in 1:1000] # many samples from derivative program\nderivative = mean(samples)\nuncertainty = std(samples) / sqrt(1000)\nprintln(\"derivative of 𝔼[X(p)] = $derivative ± $uncertainty\")","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Index","page":"Overview","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Overview","title":"Overview","text":"See the public API for a walkthrough of the API, and the tutorials on differentiating a random walk, a stochastic game of life, and a particle filter, and solving stochastic optimization and variational problems with discrete randomness.
